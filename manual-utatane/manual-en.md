## The rule about Orientation

When you play with "Orientation", add following rules to Yuri-Kure basic rule.

### Setup

Assign Orientations to each girl in the setup phase. Girls will have TWO Orientations. One kind of Orientation cannot be held by more than three girls. For example, there is no game where four girls have Cute Orientation.

In the standard rule, assign Orientations as specified in this rule book. The list of specification is shown in "List of Orientations and effects" section. Girl's Orientations are also described on back of her card.

In the advanced rule, Orientations are assigned in the way agreed by players. It includes random assignment, discussion or any other way.

### Additional phase: Game start phase

After setup where before 1st turn begins, play Game start phase. Players have chance to reveal their Control points in this phase. Like revealing in Action phase, do Control point reveal step to each girl in the Action order.

When reveal step finished at a girl having "Cool" Orientation, the player taking control declares a objective girl of ability to raise Favor level +3. If other players has more Control point over the girl, players may interrupt to reveal their Control point to change ability's objective.

When all Control point reveal step ends, advanced to 1st turn's Action phase. Game will progress same as basic game after this phase.

### Changes about Support Point

Additional Support point will be modified below in a game with Orientation.

- +3 additional Support point after 3rd turn (+1 -> +3)
- +5 additional Support point after 6th turn (+3 -> +5)

Important change from basic game: **Assigning Support point to a pair multiple time in Setup is forbidden.** It only restricts assignment in Setup phase. **Players can assign additional Support point in any combination, including duplicated assignment.**

```plaintext
At the Setup: you cannot assign like "5 to Akane-Shirakaba, 4 to Akane-Shirakaba, 3 to Midorino-Tsuge, 2 to Midorino-Sorai, 1 to Murafuji-Tsuge" (Akane-Shirakaba is duplicated)

When you assign "5 to Akane-Shirakaba, 4 to Sorai-Shirakaba, 3 to Midorino-Tsuge, 2 to Midorino-Sorai, 1 to Murafuji-Tsuge" at Setup, you can assign "2 to Sorai-Shirakaba, 1 to Midorino-Tsuge" at the end of the 3rd turn.

```

At the end of the game, the player assigned Support point most to the Fatal couple / Yuri-Polygamy group.
(Additional Support point are also summarized.)

## List of Orientations and effects

Thought Orientation token has simplified Japanese text about effect, following list is formal effect text. When you have trouble with reading simplified text on tokens, read this list.

- Aggressive - 大胆な告白 held by: Akane, Sorai
  - When a girl having Aggressive does Confession and target girl chose No, result die roll is determined as if they have +2 extra Favor level.

- Attracting - 惑わす魅力 held by: Shirakaba, Akane, Kuroki
  - In Couple phase, a pair with a girl having Attracting becomes a couple in Favor level 5 (usually required Favor level 6.) Max Favor level is still 6. Attracting does not have duplicated effect even if both girl of a pair have Attracting.

- Cool - 怜悧な美人 held by: Sorai, Momozono
  - Player taking control over this girl at Game start phase choose a pair with this girl and raise Favor level +3.

- Passive - held by: Murafuji, Midorino
  - この性向を持つ女の子が告白された時、告白をした女の子との間の好感度をその時点+1する。その後、通常の告白を受けた場合の処理の移る。(告白をされた場合、断っても断らなくても好感度+1。断った上でカップル非成立の場合、さらに好感度+1)
  - When a girl having Passive is a target of Confession, raise Favor level +1 between confessing girl immediately. After Favor level raised, proceed to normal process of Confession. (Favor level raises +1 whichever this girl choses Yes or No. If this girl choses No and did not become a couple, raise Favor level +1 again.)

- Shy - 人見知り held by: Shirakaba, Midorino
  - When a girl having Shy is a target of Approach and Favor level between approaching girl is 0, Favor level will be +3 instead of +1.

- Friendly - みんななかよし？ held by: Tsuge, Murafuji
  - A girl having Friendly have 3 vote rights on Game of Love. (Voting to just one side, cannot split.)

- Cute - あふれる可愛げ held by: Kuroki, Haila, Momozono
  - A couple will gain +1 bonus at Kiss of Promise for each Cute girls

- Attracted - 人を見つめる held by: Haila, Tsuge
  - A couple will gain bonus at die roll in Couple's phase as if their Discomfort level is -1 for each Attracted girls. (Attracted does not affect breaking up by Discomfort level 6).

Examples to resolve effects:

Akane(Aggressive/Attracting) did Confession to Murafuji(Friendly/Passive) when the Favor level is 1. Murafuji has Passive so Favor level between Akane-Murafuji raises +1 to become 2 when Akane's action is determined as Confession to Murafuji. Mufauji chose No then proceed to die roll. Die was 4. Usually die 4 will not make them couple because 4 is higher than their Favor level 2, but Akane has Aggressive so the Favor level is treated as 4 in this Confession, and die 4 is less or equal to the pseudo Favor level, it introduces Akane and Murafuji to be a couple.

Favor level between Sorai and Midorino was 1 at the end of Setup. Player A took control of Sorai on Game start phse. Sorai has cool, so player A chose to raise Favor level between Midorino. Now Favor level between Sorai and Midorino is 4 at the beginning of 1st turn.

Haila and Momozono is a couple with Favor level 2 and Discomfort level 3. Die to determine break up was 3 in the Couple's phase. They will usually break up because die 3 is less or equal to the Discomfort level, but Haila has Attracted to reduce effect Discomfort level by 1 to treat the Discomfort level as 2, so they did not break up and Discomfort level raised to 3. After this die in Kiss of Promise was 4. Usually they will fail because (die 4) + (Favor level 2) - (Discomfort level 4) = 2 and this value is less than 4, but Haila and Momozono both have Cute to gain bonus in Kiss or Promise and the final value became 4. Finally they succeed to do Kiss or Promise.

Tsuge did Game of Love to Murafuji-Momozono pair. Tsuge is the propose having Friendly so she voted Yes to 3 points. Murafuji also has Friendly but she is a part of target pair so she cannot take effect of Friendly. One of the other girl voted to yes and three voted to No. As a result, 4 votes to Yes and 3 votes to No made Game of Love passed.
